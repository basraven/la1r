## Storage Architecture
Storage architecture can be a complicated topic when working with (Bare Metal) Kubernetes clusters.
There are a lot of War stories of organizations unable to restore their storage solution, e.g. in a complex RAID setup on in a distributed storage solutions such as Ceph, GlusterFS or StorageOS.

It took a significant amount of time to weigh the pros and cons of these solutions, but eventually I went for the "safest" solution, at least a solution which could not produce unrestoreable storage solutions as mentioned before:

* Dynamically provisioned NFS storage in Kubernetes

### Storage Tiers
A few predefined folder structures are used in this setup, each folder to simulate To simulate the behavior of more complex storage solutions:

| **B**ackup | **V**olatility | **S**peed |
| ---        | ---            | ---       |
| - 1: Backed-up (**H**igh **A**vailability) <br/> - 2: Not Backed-up (**N**ormal **A**vailability)      | - 1: Persistent, retained indefinite <br/> - 2: Volatile, removed after 2 weeks | - 1: High speed SSD storage <br/> - 2: Normal speed HDD Storage <br/> - 3: Slower speed HDD storage |
